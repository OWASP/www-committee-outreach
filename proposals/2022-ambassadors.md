# Proposal for budget and process for OWASP Ambassadors 

## What is the problem we are trying to solve

It seems that there is limited understanding of OWASP around the wider developer community. Whilst people may have heard of the top 10, it is not clear that they are familar with other projects which could help them or that they can/should be more involved in OWASP events.

## Aim

To increase awareness and understanding of OWASP among the wider developer community.

## Proposal Summary

Creation of an OWASP ambassador role who would attend meetups and conferences and provide more in-depth information about getting into OWASP. 

## Proposal Details

To qualify as an OWASP ambassador, the person should commit to going to four non-OWASP events per year with the aim of advocating for OWASP and track this for audit on renewal. This would be a purely volunteer position and new applicants would have to be able to demonstrate previous OWASP involvement as well as having OWASP membership.

In return, the ambassador would receive:
* Specific recognition and thanks
* Supplies of very basic/inexpensive OWASP swag such as stickers or pens to give out
* Some dedicated OWASP apparel to make them stand out.
* Coordination with the local chapter

### OWASP stall

That should also be a budget for a certain number of larger events per year where OWASP could have a table or stall for attendees to visit and learn more. 

An OWASP ambassador would have to specifically request this  provide the following:
* Sufficient early warning to prepare and plan
* Justification for OWASP's presence at the event.
* A plan for who would volunteer to staff the table (could be coordinated with the local chapter)
* A quote for having the additional SWAG below prepared locally rather than having to ship it from elsewhere.

OWASP may fund an attendee's ticket price if they are volunteering to staff the table for at least 33% of the time they are in attendance. Otherwise, OWASP should not be paying fees associated with attending or exhibiting at the conference. 

They could then be provided with extra resources (in addition to those noted above) including:
* OWASP tablecloth
* Larger information flyers about OWASP
* Some sort of additional swag (like a unique t-shirt) to be dedicated for people who become OWASP members on the spot
