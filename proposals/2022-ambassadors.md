# Proposal for budget and process for OWASP Ambassadors 

## What is the problem we are trying to solve

It seems that there is limited understanding of OWASP around the wider developer community. Whilst people may have heard of the top 10, it is not clear that they are familar with other projects which could help them or that they can/should be more involved in OWASP events.

## Aim

To increase awareness and understanding of OWASP among the wider developer community.

In particular:
* Encourage new members to join by highlighting the benefits
* Encourage new corporate supporters by highlighting the importance of the organization
* Encourage greater involvement in the local chapter
* Showcase the variety of projects and resources which OWASP provides

## Proposal Summary

Creation of an OWASP ambassador role who would attend meetups and conferences and provide more in-depth information about getting into OWASP. 

## Proposal Details

To qualify as an OWASP ambassador, the person should commit to going to four non-OWASP events per year with the aim of advocating for OWASP and track this for audit on renewal. This would be a purely volunteer position and new applicants would have to be able to demonstrate previous OWASP involvement as well as having OWASP membership. They would also have to specifically agree to comply with the OWASP code of conduct (although they should already be subject to this as members.) 

In return, the ambassador would receive:
* Specific recognition and thanks
* Supplies of very basic/inexpensive OWASP swag such as stickers or pens to give out
* Some dedicated OWASP apparel to make them stand out.
* Coordination with the local chapter

### OWASP booth/table

That should also be a budget for a certain number of larger events per year where OWASP could have a table or stall for attendees to visit and learn more. 

An OWASP ambassador would have to specifically request this  provide the following:
* Sufficient early warning to prepare and plan
* Justification for OWASP's presence at the event.
* A plan for who would staff the table (could be coordinated with the local chapter)
* A quote for having the additional SWAG below prepared locally rather than having to ship it from elsewhere.

They could then be provided with extra resources (in addition to those noted above) including:
* OWASP tablecloth
* Larger information flyers about OWASP
* Some sort of additional swag (like a unique t-shirt) to be dedicated for people who become OWASP members on the spot


## Budget required

A yearly budget will be agreed between the outreach committee and the board with the outreach committee being responsible for how it is utilized.

The outreach committee will monitor and report on metrics such as:
- Number of non-OWASP events (meetups or conferences) attended, split by rough number of overall attendees and whether there was a booth or not.
- New memberships from each event. (This would require new functionality in the membership sign-up to include some sort of attribution field or code.)
- Geographical spread of events attended.
