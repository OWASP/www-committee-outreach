# Proposal for budget and process for OWASP Ambassadors 

## Aim

To increase awareness and understanding of OWASP among the wider tech community.

## Process

Creation of an OWASP ambassador role who would attend meetups and conferences, give out very basic/inexpensive OWASP swag such as stickers or pens and provide more in-depth information about getting into OWASP. 

To qualify as an OWASP ambassador, the person should commit to going to four non-OWASP events per year with the aim of advocating for OWASP and track this for audit on renewal. This would be a purely volunteer position and new applicants would have to be able to demonstrate previous OWASP involvement as well as having OWASP membership.

In return, the ambassador would receive:
- Specific recognition and thanks
- Supplies of the aforementioned SWAG to give out
- Some dedicated OWASP apparel to make them stand out.
- Coordination with the local chapter

That should also be a budget for larger events where OWASP could have a table or store for attendees to visit and learn more. 

An OWASP ambassador would have to specifically request this with enough time in advance to prepare and provide the following:
- Justification for OWASP's presence at the event.
- A plan for who would staff the table (could be coordinated with the local chapter)
- A quote for having the additional SWAG below prepared locally rather than having to ship it from elsewhere.

They could then be provided with additional resources including:
- OWASP tablecloth
- Larger information flyers about OWASP
- Some sort of additional swag (like a unique t-shirt) to be dedicated for people who become OWASP members on the spot
